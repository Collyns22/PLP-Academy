GOD'S LOVE AS A FOUNDATION:
THE BELIEF THAT "GOD IS LOVE" (1 JOHN 4:8) IS A CORE TENET, MEANING GOD'S VERY NATURE IS LOVE. 
THIS LOVE IS NOT MERELY AN EMOTION, BUT A POWERFUL FORCE THAT MOTIVATES GOD'S ACTIONS;
 INCLUDING THE SACRIFICE OF JESUS FOR HUMANITY'S SALVATION. 
THE LOVE OF GOD IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE DEATH OF JESUS ON THE CROSS, A DEMONSTRATION OF HIS ULTIMATE LOVE FOR HUMANITY.
CHRISTIANS ARE CALLED TO REFLECT GOD'S LOVE BY LOVING GOD WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS, SOULS, AND MINDS, AND BY LOVING THEIR NEIGHBORS
