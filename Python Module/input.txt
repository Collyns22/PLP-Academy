Hope! It’s the oxygen our souls need to thrive. Hope is the wild-eyed creature that pops up after the enemy tries to eradicate the very beating of faith in our hearts. 
It’s the essence of being a Christ.
Hope is millions of little green shoots being unearthed and reaching to the heavens.
Hope is praying your loved one will be found alive after tragedy strikes.
Hope is knowing we will be reunited with our loved ones on the other side of heaven.
Hope is the soldier who begged Jesus to use His words to heal his son miles away.
