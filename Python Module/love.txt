God's Love as a Foundation:
The belief that "God is love" (1 John 4:8) is a core tenet, meaning God's very nature is love. 
This love is not merely an emotion, but a powerful force that motivates God's actions;
 including the sacrifice of Jesus for humanity's salvation. 
The love of God is exemplified by the death of Jesus on the cross, a demonstration of His ultimate love for humanity.
Christians are called to reflect God's love by loving God with all their hearts, souls, and minds, and by loving their neighbors
